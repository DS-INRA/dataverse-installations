# Contributing to dataverse-installations

Thank you for your interest in contributing to dataverse-installations!

## Everyone is welcome

We are open to contributions from everyone. You don't need to operate an installation of Dataverse to open issues or make suggestions. Please just go ahead! We welcome contributions of ideas, bug reports, feedback, documentation, code, and anything else you can think of.

## Coding style

`reformat-all.sh` is a script you can run from the root of the repo to format code but this is optional. We can always reformat code later.

## Security

If you would like to report a security issue, please email security@dataverse.org rather than creating an issue.

## Getting help

If you have questions or need help, please reach out at [chat.dataverse.org][] or the [dataverse-community Google Group][] or by creating an issue in the [issue tracker][].
